The European Union Publications Office (OP) publishes a series of Authority tables (also known as Named Authority Lists or NALs) that are used to harmonise and standardise the codes and associated labels used in various environments (web platforms, systems and applications) and in facilitating data exchanges between the institutions involved in decision-making process across the EU and not only.
The NALs catalogue contain over 150 lists of values covering everything from Address types to Languages, Corporate bodies, Currencies, File types or Countries. Every list is made available in SKOS/RDF and several other formats depending on the specific particularity of the subject

The Country authority table is a controlled vocabulary that lists concepts associated with names of countries and territories.

Its main scope is to support documentary metadata activities.

The concepts included are correlated with the ISO 3166 international standard. ISO 3166-1 contains a two-letter code which is recommended as the general purpose code, a three-letter code which has better mnenomic properties and a numeric-3 code which can be useful if script independence of the codes is important. The authority code relies on the ISO 3166-1/alpha-3 positions. If an authority code is needed for a country without assigned ISO code, an alphanumeric code is created in order to not confuse with ISO codes that are strictly alphabetic or numeric.

A country code comparison is provided between ISO codes, IANA codes (Internet Country-code Top-level Domains) and TIR (Transport International par la Route) Vehicle system codes.

The Language authority table is a controlled vocabulary that lists concepts associated with languages.

Its main scope is to support activities associated with publication process.

The concepts included are correlated with the ISO 639 international standard. This standard is issued in several parts:

ISO 639-1 contains strictly two alphabetic letters (alpha-2),

ISO 639-2/B (B = bibliographic) is used for bibliographic purpose (alpha-3),

ISO 639-2/T (T = terminology) is used for technical purpose (alpha-3),

ISO 639-3 covers all the languages and macro-languages of the world (alpha-3); the values are compliant with ISO 639-2/T.

If an authority code is needed for a language without assigned ISO code, an alphanumeric code is created in order to not confuse with ISO codes that are strictly alphabetic.

Contributions to the Language authority table are accepted following a review made by EU Vocabularies team of the Publications Office of the EU.
