The Parole/Simple 'lemon' Ontology is the OWL version of the Parole / Simple model (defined during the PAROLE LE2-4017 and SIMPLE LE4-8346 projects) once mapped to the lemon  Model.
The goal of SIMPLE project was to add semantic information, selected for its relevance for LE applications, to the set 
of harmonised multifunctional lexica built for 12 European languages by the PAROLE consortium. PAROLE +SIMPLE lexicons 
contain morphological, syntactic and semantic information, organised according to a common model and to common linguistic 
specifications. 

The original Parole/Simple model expressed in the parole DTD has been mapped into the lemon model (http://lemon-model.net/). 
Thus the resulting Parole/Simple Ontology imports the Lexinfo+lemon Ontology and adds 'parole elements' (classes and/or properties)
whenever these cannot be mapped to any 'lexinfo element'. 
The Spanish lexicon includes 7572 entries fully annotated with syntactic and semantic information.
The Catalan lexicon includes 20545 entries annotated with syntactic information half of which are also annotated with semantic information. The latest version of the Catalan lexicon is linked to the Catalan EuroWordNet lemon lexicon (http://lod.iula.upf.edu/resources/WordNetLemonCAT)

These resources were developed with the support of METANET4U: Enhancing the European Linguistic Infrastructure, (2011-2013), funded by UNER - Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Program, (CIP-PSP-270893).
