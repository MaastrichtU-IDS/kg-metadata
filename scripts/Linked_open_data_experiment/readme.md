##  Validate LOD Metadata

As a use case, we validate LOD metadata against SHACL-based metadata specifications. The 2025 LOD cloud contains 1,573 datasets and includes 17 metadata fields in its catalog. As described in the paper, we map elements of the LOD metadata schema to the vocabularies defined in our specification and generate a Turtle file compatible with the validation framework. To generate LOD metadata compatible to dpecification and validate it, you can run LOD/lod_ttl_gen.ipynb notebook. The output will be a report of violations.
