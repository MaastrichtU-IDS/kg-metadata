##  Validate LOD Metadata

As a use case, we validate LOD metadata against SHACL-based metadata specifications. The 2025 LOD cloud contains 1,573 datasets and includes 17 metadata fields in its catalog. As described in the paper, we map elements of the LOD metadata schema to the vocabularies defined in our specification and generate a Turtle file compatible with the validation framework. To generate LOD metadata compatible to dpecification and validate it, you can run notebooks/lod_ttl_gen.ipynb notebook. The output will be a report of violations. Please note some of the elemets like title are common in the KG descriptions. For example we have Title of the KG and Title for distribution. 


To accurately count the number of errors per element, it is necessary to distinguish between similar cases such as KG title and distribution title. For this purpose, we employ a script that is functionally identical to the main LOD generation script, with the only difference being the addition of labels (e.g., Title_main and Title_distribution) to differentiate these common elements. This ensures that the violation report can be consistently reproduced, allowing all researchers to obtain the same results as those reported in the paper.
